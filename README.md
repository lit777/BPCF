# Bayesian Nonparametric Trees for Principal Causal Effects (BPCF)

- Simulation scenario I
1. Run main.R in the sim1 folder for the proposed model
2. Run BART.R in the sim1 folder for the BART model

- Simulation scenario II
1. Run main.R in the sim2 folder for the proposed model
2. Run BART.R in the sim2 folder for the BART model

- Application (Air Quality Study)
0. MasterXX.RData in /Application/souce/ are compiled datasets for the main and alternative analyses
1. Run main.R in the Application folder for the proposed model
2. Run main_sp.R in the Application folder for the proposed model with spatial random effects
